# Section 06: Project Management Concepts

## S06-056: Reviewing the Project Management Process Groups

  - Processes per state:
    
      - Initiating **(2)**
    
      - Planning **(24)**
    
      - Executing **(10)**
    
      - Monitoring and Controlling **(12)**
    
      - Closing **(1)**

## S06-057: Work Performance Data, Information, and Reports

  - Work Performance Data (WPD):
    
      - The raw data and facts about a project.
    
      - Statuses of work such as percentage complete, start and finish
        dates, etc.
    
      - Can include the costs, number of change requests, and durations.

  - Work Performance Information (WPI):
    
      - WPD that has been further analyzed.
    
      - Is the first step of usable information used to make decisions.

  - Work Performance Reports (WPR):
    
      - How the WPI data is packaged and presented.
    
      - Includes status reports, dashboards, etc.

## S06-058: Tailoring the Processes

  - There are **four** key criteria to consider:
    
      - Which process will/should be utilized?
    
      - What will be the depth that the processes should be used?
    
      - Not every process is needed on every project.
    
      - The larger the project, the more processes that may be needed.

  - All of the processes live within the knowledge area.

## S06-059: Introduction to Adaptive Environments

  - Predictive (Waterfall):
    
      - Plan driven.
    
      - Predicts the entirety of the project lifecycle.

  - Iterative / Adaptive / Incremental:
    
      - Phases repeat through iteration.
    
      - Iterations create the deliverables.
    
      - Changes to scope are expected.
    
      - Detailed scope is elaborated for each iteration (sprint).
    
      - Agile

  - Product backlog is prioritized by the **product owner**. They can
    modify the priority between sprints.

## S06-060: Introducing Business Documents

  - Phase gates (review before next phase) could be deliverables and
    impact schedule.

  - Decisions at the phase gate could also be a kill point if the
    project is no longer viable.

  - Decisions include:
    
      - Continue to next phase.
    
      - Continue to the next phase with modifications.
    
      - End the project.
    
      - Remain in the same phase.
    
      - Repeat the phase or elements of it.

## S06-061: Project Business Case

  - A business case is the fiscal feasibility of the project.

  - It validates the business value.

  - It is maintained by the **project sponsor** throughout the project.

  - The business level can be at the **program** level.

  - The business case can include **root cause analysis, gap analysis,**
    and **critical success criteria.**

  - Analysis of a situation can include:
    
      - 01: Required
    
      - 02: Desired
    
      - 03: Optional

  - Typically results in a recommendation.

## S06-062: Project Business Management

  - Describes how you will generate benefits for the organization.

  - A benefit is the value to the organization.

  - This also defines how to create, expand, and sustain benefits.
