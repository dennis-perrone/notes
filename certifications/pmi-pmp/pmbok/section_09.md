# Session 09: Implementing Project Integration Management

## S09-091: Project Integration Management

  - The **project manager** needs to determine how events impact the
    projects baseline.

  - The **project manager** measures the projects progress and ensures
    that it is all entered into the Project Management Information
    System (PMIS).

  - Some hybrid methodologies can be brought into the PMIS such as
    hybrid and predictive.

## S09-092: Tailoring Project Integration Management

  - Make sure to only use the processes needed and to only use them at
    the required depth required by the project.

  - The PMO may (and should) hold best practices for the organization.

  - There are multiple fields and values that can be tailored depending
    on the individual needs of the specific project.

## S09-095: Examining Benefit Measurement Methods

  - A tool to choose which project is most valuable to the organization.

  - The following is the **formula** for the **future value of money**:
    
      - \({FV = PV(1 + i)}^{N}\)
        
          - FV = Future value
        
          - PV = Present value
        
          - I = Given interest rate (or rate of return)
        
          - N = Number of periods (cycles)

  - The following is the **formula** for the **present value of money**:
    
      - \({PV = FV/(1 + i)}^{N}\)
        
          - PV = Present value
        
          - FV = Future value
        
          - I = Given interest rate (or rate of return)
        
          - N = Number of periods (cycles)

  - **Net Present Value (NPV)** is used to find the true value of a
    project.
    
      - Find the present value utilizing the formulas listed above and
        work the formula for each year (period).
    
      - Anything that returns above **zero** is a gain.

  - **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** is where the present value equals
    the cash inflow.
    
      - The bigger/higher the IRR, the better.
    
      - Anything that returns about **zero** is good.

## S09-096: Creating an Assumption Log

  - The **assumption log** is the document that holds all assumptions
    and constraints.

  - This document is living and is updated throughout the project
    lifecycle.

## S09-097: Developing the Project Charter

  - The **charter** is updated throughout the project and defines how it
    is executed, maintained, controlled, and closed.

  - Once everything is approved, it is **baselined**. After the baseline
    is generated, all changes to the project plan are required to go
    through the **change management process.**

  - There should be discussions in the planning phase of the project on
    which documents are baselined.

  - The **kickoff meeting** marks the end of **planning** and the start
    of **execution.**

  - A typical project plan contains the following:
    
      - Scope management plan
    
      - Requirement management plan
    
      - Schedule management plan
    
      - Cost management plan
    
      - Quality management plan
    
      - Resource management plan
    
      - Communications management plan
    
      - Risk management plan
    
      - Procurement management plan
    
      - Stakeholder management plan

## S09-098: Directing and Managing Project Work

  - Ensure all project requirements are satisfied.

  - The **project manager** will need to collect all data and metrics.

  - Utilize a PMIS.

## S09-099: Actions on a Project Manager

  - The following actions typically require a **change request**:
    
      - **Corrective**: Realigns the project performance.
    
      - **Preventative**: Ensures the future performance.
    
      - **Defect Repair**: Modified a project that is in
        non-conformance.

  - Some corrective actions can include realigning project work with the
    approved baseline.

## S09-100: Deliverables

  - Output from the project (anything that the project creates).

  - Configuration management is controlling multiple versions of a
    deliverable.

## S09-101: Work Performance Data (WPD)

  - Raw data thatâ€™s based from project work (as long as there are
    metrics to track it).

  - Analyzed and turned into **Work Performance Information (WPI).**

## S09-102: Issue Log

  - Issues are risk events that have occurred and are disruptions within
    the project.

  - The log will typically list the owner, data, and issue description.

## S09-103: Managing Project Knowledge

  - There are **two** types of knowledge:
    
      - Explicit: quantifiable data
    
      - Tacit: unquantifiable. Things such as feelings or past
        experiences.

  - There are **ten** techniques:
    
      - Storytelling
    
      - Knowledge fairs and cafes
    
      - Work shadowing (the amateur follows the expert)
    
      - Reverse shadowing (the expert follows the amateur and provides
        coaching)
    
      - Creativity and idea management
    
      - Discussion forms and focus groups
    
      - Networking
    
      - Communities of Practice (CoP)
    
      - Meetings to discuss projects
    
      - Training events to share knowledge

## S09-104: Monitoring and Controlling the Project Work

  - There are a few different types of analysis for quantifying project
    work:
    
      - **Alternative Analysis**: Corrective and preventative actions to
        fix problems.
    
      - **Cost Benefit Analysis:** Cost of the proposed corrective
        action.
    
      - **Earned Value Analysis:** Formulas to show the project status.

## S09-105: Performing Integrated Change Control

  - Integrated change control is controlled by the **project manager.**

  - Configuration control defines how to generate and produce
    deliverable items.

  - Configuration control consists of the following actions:
    
      - Identification
    
      - Status Accounting
    
      - Verification and Auditing

  - Scope creep happens when changes bypass the change control process.
