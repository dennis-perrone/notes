# Session 10: Managing the Project Scope

## S10-110: Planning Project Scope Management

  - Planning (the process) will create 2 sub-plans:
    
      - Scope management plan
    
      - Requirement management plan

  - To create these, the scope will need to be defined. The scope
    management plan will define how the project is assigned, developed,
    monitored, controlled, and validated.

  - The **project charter** should be a key input into the scope
    management plan.

  - This is the step where the management approach (methodology) such as
    predictive or agile.

  - Once baselined, any changes to the scope must go through the change
    management process.

## S10-111: Project Scope versus Product Scope

  - Product scope are features and functions.

  - Project scope is the work to be completed. This work is required to
    satisfy the project objectives.

  - Project lifecycle:
    
      - **Predictive:**
        
          - **Scope:** The scope is defined at the beginning of the
            project. (Waterfall)
        
          - **Change:** Resistant to change once schedule has been
            baselined.
    
      - **Adaptive:**
        
          - **Scope:** The scope is defined through iterations.
        
          - **Change:** Expect and embrace change throughout the project
            lifecycle.

  - The **product scope** is what was promised versus what was
    delivered.

## S10-112: Trends and Emerging Practices in Project Scope Management

  - **Business Analysis** is defining, managing, and controlling
    requirements.

  - Requirements can begin with a need’s assessment.

  - **Business Analysis (BA)** versus **Project Manager (PM):**
    
      - **Business Analysis:** Responsible for requirements.
    
      - **Project Manager:** Responsible for project delivery.

## S10-113: Considerations for an Adaptive Environment

  - Scope is not fully defined at the start of the project.

  - **Grooming** the backlog is done by the **product owner.**

  - Scrum artifacts: The **product backlog** is the source for all
    project requirements.

  - In an agile environment, the development team determines the
    capacity.

## S10-114: Project Requirements

  - The nest way to determine stakeholder requirements is by
    interviewing them.

  - **Focus Groups:** These are mediated events with roughly **6-12**
    people.

  - There are generally **four** types of decisions derived from group
    discussions:
    
      - **Unanimity:** Everyone agrees.
    
      - **Majority:** More than 50% agree.
    
      - **Plurality:** The largest block agrees. This is applicable when
        there are more than 2 choices.
    
      - **Dictatorship:** Power decides.

  - **Five** steps to the **nominal group** technique:
    
      - Generate ideas.
    
      - Each participant brainstorms with his/her own idea.
    
      - The ideas that are brainstormed will be added to a white board.
    
      - The group talks through the ideas.
    
      - There is a private (anonymous) vote.

  - **Facilitated workshops:** Get all of the SME’s/developers into one
    spot, typically off-site.

  - **Agile requirement gathering:**
    
      - User stories are broken down into **three** sub-sections:
        
          - **Role: Who** benefits from the feature?
        
          - **Goal:** What is the **stakeholder** trying to accomplish?
        
          - **Motivation:** What’s the benefit **to the stakeholder**?

## S10-116: Defining the Project Scope Statement

  - This document describes the **product, service, or result** and
    establishes both **boundaries** and **acceptance criteria.**

  - The **scope baseline** includes:
    
      - Project scope statement
    
      - Project work breakdown structure (WBS)
    
      - Project WBS dictionary

  - **Value Engineering:** How much value can a product provide to its
    customers.

  - Alternative generation can happen against multiple things:
    
      - Benchmarking
    
      - Systems
    
      - Vendors
    
      - Materials
    
      - Resources

  - The **project charter document** is higher than the **scope
    statement** and gives authority. The **scope statement** defines
    what needs to be done.

## S10-117: Work Breakdown Structure Creation

  - Decomposes the entirety of the project scope.

  - The smallest item is called a **work package.**
