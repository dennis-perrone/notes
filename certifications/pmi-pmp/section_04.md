# Section 04: Define Project Management Foundations

## S04-034: Projects Create Unique Products, Services, or Results

  - Projects accomplish one of **four** things:
    
      - **M**oving something
    
      - **A**dding something
    
      - **C**hanging something
    
      - **D**eleting something

  - Remember **MAC-D** for the 4 reasons to have a project

## S04-039: Project Enable Business Value Creation

  - A business value is the benefit for the organization or the
    stakeholders.

  - There are **two** types of benefits:
    
      - **Tangible**: Quantitative (money, something you can touch,
        etc.)
    
      - **Intangible**: Qualitative (good will, brand recognition, etc.)

  - Date: 05.28.2021

  - There is typically a defined business case. The **why** projects are
    created.

      - Technological advances
    
      - Create, improve, or fix existing processes or services

      - **Planning**
    
      - **Executing**
    
      - **Monitor and Controlling**
    
      - **Closing**

  - Progressive elaboration: The process of further developing a
    requirement as you go along.

## S04-043: Reviewing a Project Lifecycle

  - Project management life cycle is contained in **IPECC**:
    
      - **Initiating**
    
      - **Planning**
    
      - **Executing**
    
      - **Controlling**
    
      - **Closing**

  - The project lifecycle is unique to each type of project.

  - There is a **milestone** at the end of each project phase.
