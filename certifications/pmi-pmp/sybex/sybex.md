<a name="ch-01_establishing-a-baseline"></a>

### Establishing a baseline
Definition of a project:
* Temporary in nature.
* Definitive start and end dates.
* Produce a unique product, service, or result.
* Completed when goals and objectives are met and signed off by a **stakeholder**.

Operations are different from a project since operations are ongoing and repetitive in nature.

### Programs

* **Programs** are a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and other activities.
    * These are grouped together using similar management techniques 
    * Meant to utilize benefits that wouldn't be present if the projects were to be managed individually.

**Kanban**, **Scrum**, and **Lean** are all agile methodologies.
* Kanban and Scrum are both **pull** systems.

### Exploring the Project Knowledge Areas

**Process Groups**
* There are **five** total groups:
    * Initiating
    * Planning

    * Risks associated with the benefits.
* This plan will be reviewed at each **phase gate**.

### Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)
* Can be both *internal* and *external* to the organization.
* Internal:
    * Resource availability
    * Office location

* There are **two** categories:
    * Process, policies, and procedures
    * Organizational knowledge bases

### Project Integration Management
* There are **three** levels of project integration.

    * Define scope (Monitoring and Controlling)

* Overall project scope includes the **product** and the **project** scope.
    * **Product**: Characteristics of the product, service or result
    * **Project**: Managing the work of the project.

* The project scope is measured against the **project management plan**.

### Project Cost Management
* Focuses on budgets and project costs.
* This is where the following occur:
    * Cost estimates
    * Budgets
* There may be requirements to bring in additional finance SME's in the event *specialized* knowledge is required.
* There are **two** techniques to improve the project process:
    * Life-cycle costing:
        * Initial investments and the potential incurred cost throughout the life of the project.
    * Value engineering:
        * Focused on project performance optimization.
        * Mainly concerned with eliminating unnecessary costs.


### Project Quality Management
* Knowledge areas (contains **three** processes):
    * Plan quality management (Planning)
    * Manage quality (Executing)
    * Control quality (Monitoring and Controlling)

* Focused on:
    * Quality of the product
    * Quality of the project management processes
* Within **agile**, quality is checked iteratively during each iteration.
