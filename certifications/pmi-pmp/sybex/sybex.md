## Chapter 01: Building the Foundation <a name="ch01_building-the-foundation"></a>

### Establishing a baseline <a name="ch01_establishing-a-baseline"></a>
Definition of a project:
* Temporary in nature.
* Definitive start and end dates.
* Produce a unique product, service, or result.
* Completed when goals and objectives are met and signed off by a **stakeholder**.

Operations are different from a project since operations are ongoing and repetitive in nature.

### Programs <a name="ch01_programs"></a>

* **Programs** are a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and other activities.
    * These are grouped together using similar management techniques 
    * Meant to utilize benefits that wouldn't be present if the projects were to be managed individually.

</p>

**Kanban**, **Scrum**, and **Lean** are all agile methodologies.
* Kanban and Scrum are both **pull** systems.


## Chapter 02: Assessing Project Needs <a name="ch02_assessing-project-needs"></a>

### Project Integration Management <a name="ch02_proj-integration-mgmt"></a>
* There are **three** levels of project integration.
    * Process level
    * Cognitive level
    * Context level
* Project Management Information System (PMIS):
    * Used to document project plan.
    * Facilitates a feedback process for documentation revision.
    * Can be used to control project plans.
    * Collection and distribution point for project information.

### Project Scope Management <a name="ch02_proj-scope-mgmt"></a>

    * Define scope (Monitoring and Controlling)

* Overall project scope includes the **product** and the **project** scope.
    * **Product**: Characteristics of the product, service or result
    * **Project**: Managing the work of the project.

* The project scope is measured against the **project management plan**.

### Project Cost Management <a name="ch02_proj-cost-mgmt"></a>
* Focuses on budgets and project costs.
* This is where the following occur:
    * Cost estimates
    * Budgets
* There may be requirements to bring in additional finance SME's in the event *specialized* knowledge is required.
* There are **two** techniques to improve the project process:
    * Life-cycle costing:
        * Initial investments and the potential incurred cost throughout the life of the project.
    * Value engineering:
        * Focused on project performance optimization.
        * Mainly concerned with eliminating unnecessary costs.

    * Plan quality management (Planning)
    * Manage quality (Executing)
    * Control quality (Monitoring and Controlling)

* Focused on:
    * Quality of the product

    * Plan resource management
    * Estimate activity resources
    * Acquire resources

### Project Risk Management <a name="ch02_proj-risk-mgmt"></a>
* Knowledge areas (contains **seven** processes):
    * Plan risk management (Planning)
    * Identify risks (Planning)
    * Perform qualitative risk analysis (Planning)
    * Perform quantitative risk analysis (Planning)
    * Plan risk responses (Planning)
    * Implement risk response (Executing)
    * Monitor risks (Monitoring and Controlling)

* **Project viability** is typically addressed by the **steering committee**. They typically request project ideas, have a meeting (to review submissions), then make a determination if the project will be executed.

* Project selection is performed by the **project sponsor**, **customer**, **or SME's**. This is accomplished with methods such as **benefit-cost ratio analysis** and **scoring models**.

### Benefit-Cost Ratio Analysis (BCR) <a name="ch02_bcr"></a>
* Compares the cost to produce to the potential benefit to the business.
* This should include all factors of a project.
* Also known as a **cost benefit analysis**.

### Scoring Models <a name="ch02_scoring-models"></a>
* Used when the steering committee determines common criteria to compare different projects.
* Multiple, common projects will all use the same criteria.

### Cash Flow Analysis <a name="ch02_cash-flow-analysis"></a>
* Includes formulas such as:
    * Payback period (PBP)
    * Discount cash flow
    * Net present value (NPV)
    * Intentional rate of return (IRR)

### Payback period (PBP) <a name="ch02_pbp"></a>
* How long it will take a company to recap the initial cost of the project.
* Compares the **initial cost** to the **expected cash flow** over the anticipated life of the project.
* **Example**: Initial investment of a project is **$200k** and is expected to bring in **$25k/quarter** for the first **two** years, then **50k/year** afterwards. The PBP is reached within **two years**.

### Discounted cash flow <a name="ch02_discounted-cash-flow"></a>
* The concept that future money is worth less than current money.
* Future value:
    * Example:
        * Borrow **$2k** for **three years** at **5% interest**.
        * FV = 2000(1.05)<sup>3</sup>
        * FV = 2000(1.157625)
        * FV = 2,315.25
    * Formula:
        <p align="left">
            <img style="padding-top:10px" src=./images/formula-future-value.svg>
        </p>
* Discounted cash flow:
    * Example:
        * What is **$2,315.25** worth in **three years**.
        * PV = 2,315.25/(1.05)<sup>3</sup>
        * PV = 2,315.25/1.157625
        * PV = 2,000
    * Formula:    
        <p align="left">
            <img style="padding-top:10px" src=./images/formula-discounted-cash-flow.svg>
        </p>

### Net present values <a name="ch02_npv"></a>
* Enables the calculation of expected revenue or cash inflow from the project in **today's dollars**.
* If NPV is **greater than 0**, accept the project.
* If NPC is **less than 0**, reject the project.

### Intentional rate of return <a name="ch02_irr"></a>
* The discount rate when the present value of the **cash inflow** equals the **original investment**.

### Assessing Project Needs and Creating the Project Charter <a name="ch02_assessing-project-needs"></a>
* The **project charter** is the formal start of the project.
* It gives the project manager **authority** within the project.
* The **project sponsor** needs to create **two** separate documents:
    * **Business case**: Documents the business value of the project and if it's worth undertaking.
    * **Benefits management plan**: Outlines the benefits that the project brings to the organization.

### Business Case <a name="ch02_business-case"></a>
* It's a good idea to perform a **needs assessment** first.
* Typically, includes:
    * Project description
    * Business need and demand
    - Opportunity
    * High-level scope
    * Involved stakeholders
    * Problem analysis
    * High-level description of risks
* **Three** categories are used for **decision analysis**:
    * Required
    * Desired
    * Optional
* The **three decision analysis** categories are used to categorize the criticality of a factor to the success of a project.
* There will be **one** of **two** outcomes:
    * Proceed with the project charter
    * Deny the request

### Benefits Management Plan <a name="ch02_benefits-management-plan"></a>
* Outlines the intended benefits and business value.
* Defines how benefits will be measured.
* Can include:
    * Target benefits
    * Strategic alignment
    *Timeframe
    * Who will track when the benefits are realized
    * Metrics
    * Risks associated with benefits
* This should be reviewed at each **phase gate**.

### Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF) <a name="ch02_enterprise-environmental-factors"></a>
* These can be **internal** and **external** to the organization.
* Internal factors:
    * Resource availability
    * Office location
    * Company culture
* External factors:
    * Government standards
    * Industry standards
    * Product specifications

### Organizational Process Assets (OPA) <a name="ch02_opa"></a>
* Consists of:
    * Policies
    * Guidelines
    * Processes
    * Procedures
    * Plans
* There are **two** categories for OPA's:
    * Processes, policies, and procedures
    * Organizational knowledge bases
